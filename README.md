## Final Project

For my final project I chose to attempt to expand my smoker project and add email alerts.  To this point I have not been able to even see if my code works because i haven't been able to update python in environment.  However, this will at least give me a starting point from which to work.


# Prerequisites

This script require pika, sys, webbrowser, csv, time, deque, tomlib (requires Python 3.11), pprint, EmailMessage (from email.message), and smtplib.


# How to run the code

In an evironment with the prerequisits installed run the code using the python bbqprod.py command

Once the producer code is running, open 3 more terminal (that have the preequists Installed) and run smokercon.py, foodacon.py, and foodbcon.py

If you need to stop streaming at any poin, press Crtl + C to end the code in the terminal of your choice.

I have included the code to open the RabbitMQ console.
